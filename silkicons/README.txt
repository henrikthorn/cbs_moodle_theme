SILK ICONS THEME README

This theme was created specifically to enhance the standard theme of Moodle 2.0
with a brighter, more colourful icon set. Only the most minor of adjustments are
made via CSS (usually just icon spacing/padding and sizing).

A BIG thank you goes out to Mark James of Birmingham UK for his work in creating
the silk icons which he offers on his website http://famfamfam.com.
He offers the silk icons used in this theme for free under either the
